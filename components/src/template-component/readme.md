# Template Component

This folder uses the checkbox component to provide you with a complete
component but also a relatively simple one to get you started created
newer ones for components you're working on.

# Run demos or contribute

* Run `npm install` in the `/components/` folder
* Then run `npm run dev`, this will compile the code and the browser to the index with links
to component demos
